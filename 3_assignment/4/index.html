            <p>
                This website contains fragments from the Book of Programming, 
                an ancient tome lost to time.
            </p>

        <p>
            The book is said to have been written by a disciple of <a href="people/fu-tzu.html">Fu-Tzu</a>,
            the legendary master programmer.
        </p>

            Currently, two sections have been recovered:
        <ul>
            <li>a <a href="sections/aspects.html">section</a>  describing the two aspects of programming (data and control).</li>
            <li>a <a href="sections/wisdom.html">section</a> reporting short-sayings and other wisdom of the master Fu-Tzu.</li> 
        </ul>
